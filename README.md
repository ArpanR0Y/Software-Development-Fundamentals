# Software-Development-Fundamentals

This course, part of the CS Essentials for Software Development Professional Certificate program, covered Java syntax and keywords and along side exploring the features of object-oriented programming including encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism. . I learned how to apply these concepts to programmatic solve problems by investigating class modeling techniques and relationships such as aggregation, realization, and generalization.

In addition to programming, I learned and practiced the following: 

1. Software testing techniques that helped me find problems in my code, all while using a modern development environment, IntelliJ IDEA for tasks like debugging and unit testing using JUnit. 
2. Using Gradle as my build automation tool and to manage my dependancies. 
3. Using Github Actions to create a Continuous Integration (CI) pipeline to test everytime I pushed my code to the master branch.

After completing this course, I was able to design, develop, and test applications in Java and understand and apply core principles of professional software development to my open source projects.
