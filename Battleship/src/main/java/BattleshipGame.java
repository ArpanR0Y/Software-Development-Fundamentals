  /**
   * The BattleshipGame class is the ”main” class–that is, it contains a main method. In this class
   * you will set up the game; accept ”shots” from the user; display the results; print final
   * scores; and ask the user if he/she wants to play again. All input/output is done here (although
   * some of it is done by calling a print() method in the Ocean class.) All computation will be
   * done in the Ocean class and the various Ship classes.
   * <p>
   * Note that you want to accept 5 shots from the user. So you need to ensure that you have a well
   * defined format for this. For example you can provide an instruction to the user as follows The
   * input format should look like this: 1, 1; 0, 3; 7, 3; 9, 11; 12, 17
   * <p>
   * Note you will need to use the split method to parse this input string.
   * <p>
   * To aid the user, row numbers should be displayed along the left edge of the array, and column
   * numbers should be displayed along the top. Numbers should be 0 to 19, not 1 to 20. The top left
   * corner square should be 0, 0. Use different characters to indicate locations that contain a
   * hit, locations that contain a miss, and locations that have never been fired upon.
   * <p>
   * Use methods. Don’t cram everything into one or two methods, but try to divide up the work into
   * sensible parts with reasonable names.
